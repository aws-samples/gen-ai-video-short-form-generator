# GenAI Video Short-form Generator

This repository is a sample generative AI video short-form generator application that uses Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Transcribe orchestrated with AWS serverless services.
This sample application takes in long videos, understands it, and extracts and generate up to 15 short-form highlight video. 
It uses distant parts from the video to make more than 10 engaging, short-form content with titles and subtitles.
The app also gives flexibility in choosing which frame to put in, and also the ability to edit titles and subtitles auto-generated by LLMs.
